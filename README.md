Code Challenges
===============

How does this work?
-------------------

Whenever I find a cool code challenge I'll throw it in a folder here. Anyone is welcome to pull request their own solutions (as new files) into that challenge's directory.

In competitive challenges (e.g. code golfing), if you think you can improve someone else's submission, go for it! If you can get it shorter, that'll be your name next to it for the most recent commit! :)

Any languages, paradigms, or whatever are welcome.
