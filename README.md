Code Challenges
===============

How does this work?
-------------------

Whenever I find a cool code challenge I'll throw it in a folder here.

Anyone is welcome to pull request their own solutions (as new files) into that challenge's directory. Just browse around through the directories above to browse challenges, and check out the README in each directory (conveniently displayed for you in GitHub) to read about the challenge. If you want, you can check out the code samples in the same directory to browse peoples' submissions.

In competitive challenges (e.g. code golfing), if you think you can improve someone else's submission, go for it! If you can get it shorter, that'll be your name next to it for the most recent commit! :)

Any languages, paradigms, or whatever are welcome.
