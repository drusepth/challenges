Palindrome
==========

Challenge
---------

Write a program that outputs "Hello World" in which the _source code_ is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same forward as it does backwards.

Restrictions
------------

1. Whitespace can be ignored for palindromic correctness
2. No comments allowed on this one! (Looking at you @hfukada)
3. The output must be exactly "Hello World", with or without a final newline.
