Obfizzcatebuzz
==========

Challenge
---------

Write the standard FizzBuzz program (outlined below) without using the words "Fizz" or "Buzz", or the numbers 3 or 5, in your source code.

FizzBuzz
--------

Write a program that outputs the numbers 1 through 100, separated by newlines, except for the following cases:

1. When a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
2. When a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number
3. When a number is divisible by 3 _and_ 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number

Restrictions
------------

1. 3 and 5 can appear in your source code if they are part of other numbers (e.g. 53 or 113) -- just not by themselves (3 or 5).
